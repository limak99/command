Create your own projects and experiment with different techniques and technologies. 
Build a personal website or a small web app to showcase your skills.

6.Learn a back-end programming language: Once you are comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can start learning a back-end programming language. 
Some popular options include PHP, Python, and Ruby. This will enable you to build more complex web applications that interact with a database.

7.Learn a web framework: A web framework is a collection of tools and libraries that makes it easier to build web applications.
